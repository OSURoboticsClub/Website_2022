# OSCR's SPARC Robot Construction Specifications v1.5

## 1. Overview and Purpose
- 1.1. The SPARC Robot Construction Specifications was created to provide both builders and event organizers with an up to date and easy to implement ruleset.
- 1.2. The SPARC Standard Ruleset will call out areas where the rules are often altered by the events and will provide the most frequently used options for easy adaptation.
- 1.3. If you choose to utilize the SPARC Robot Construction Specifications and modify the rules to adapt to your event please note specific areas that differ from the standard SPARC rules in section 2.

## 2. Deviations From Robot Construction Specifications
- 2.1. This section is provided as a location to provide a brief outline of where the rules for a specific event differ from the SPARC Robot Construction Specifications.
- 2.2. All changes from the baseline SPARC Robot Construction Specifications shall be clearly highlighted to allow easy identification of deviations from the original document. Use a ~~strikethrough~~ to mark off removed rules text.

## 3. General
- 3.1. All participants build and operate robots at their own risk. Combat robotics is inherently dangerous. There is no amount of regulation that can encompass all the dangers involved. Please take care to not hurt yourself or others when building, testing and competing.
- 3.2. If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizer. Safe innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the event staff with your brilliant exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it ever competes.
- 3.3. Each event has safety inspections. It is at their sole discretion that your robot is allowed to compete. As a builder you are obligated to disclose all operating principles and potential dangers to the inspection staff.
- 3.4. Cardinal Safety Rules: Failure to comply with any of the following rules could result in expulsion or worse, injury and death.
    - 3.4.1. Radios that do not operate using spread spectrum technology may not be turned on at or near events for any purpose without obtaining the appropriate frequency clip or explicit permission from the event.
    - 3.4.2. Proper activation and deactivation of robots is critical. Robots must only be activated in the arena, testing areas, or with expressed consent of the event and it's safety officials.
    - 3.4.3. All robots must be able to be FULLY deactivated, which includes power to drive and weaponry, in under 60 seconds by a manual disconnect.
    - 3.4.4. All robots not in an arena or official testing area must be raised or blocked up in a manner so that their wheels or legs cannot cause movement if the robot were turned on. Runaway bots are VERY dangerous.
    - 3.4.5. Locking devices: Moving weapons that can cause damage or injury must have a clearly visible locking device in place at all times when not in the arena. Locking devices must be clearly identified. Examples of acceptable options include neon paint, brightly colored tabs, and remove before flight tags. Locking devices must be painted in neon orange or another high-visibility color. Locking devices must be clearly capable to stopping, arresting or otherwise preventing harmful motion of the weapon.
    - 3.4.6. Weapon locking pins must be in place when weapon power is applied during a robot’s power-on procedure. This includes all powered weapons regardless of the power source or weight class.
    - 3.4.7. It is expected that all builders will follow basic safety practices during work on the robot at your pit station. Please be alert and aware of your pit neighbors and people passing by.

## 4. Weight Classes
§4.1: For ease of reading, only hosted weight classes are listed (1 & 3 pounds).

_Note that rules for Plastic Antweight are listed in §16, Weight Class Variants_

_This event offers the weight classes listed on the event registration page._

- 4.1.
  - 4.1.1. Shufflers receive a 1.25x weight bonus
  - 4.1.2. Non-Traditional receive a 1.5x weight bonus
  - 4.1.3. Walkers receive a 2x weight bonus

| Rolling      | Shufflers | Non-Traditional | Walker |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------- | ------ |
| 1lb / 454g   | 1.25 lb   | 1.5 lb          | 2 lb   |
| 3lb / 1.36kg | 3.75 lb   | 4.5 lb          | 6 lb   |


## 5. Mobility
- 5.1. All robots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete. Methods of mobility include but are not limited to:
    - 5.1.1. Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot)
    - 5.1.2. Walking: Walking robots have no rolling elements in contact with the floor and no continuous rolling or cam operated motion in contact with the floor, either directly or via a linkage. Motion is “continuous” if continuous operation of the drive motor(s) produces continuous motion of the robot. Linear-actuated legs and novel non-wheeled drive systems may qualify for this bonus. If you are intending to enter a non-wheeled robot in any event contact the event as soon as possible to determine what if any weight bonus you will qualify for.
    - 5.1.3. Shuffling (rotational cam operated legs)  
    - 5.1.4. Non-Traditional
        - 5.1.4.1. Bristle/Torque Drive: Vibration or torque reaction of a powered system to generate motion
        - 5.1.4.2. Gyro Walker: Gyroscopic forces used in conjunction with a rotating arm that tilts a portion of the robot to generate motion
        - 5.1.4.3. Ground effect air cushions (hovercrafts)
        - 5.1.4.4. Jumping and hopping may be allowed at some events, contact the event organizer if you’re intending on using this as a method of locomotion.
        - 5.1.4.5. Flying (airfoil using, helium balloons, ornithopters, etc.)may be allowed at some events, contact the event organizer if you’re intending on using this as a method of locomotion.

## 6. Robot control requirements
- 6.1. Tele-operated robots must be radio controlled, or use an approved custom system as described in 6.4.3. Radio controlled robots must use approved ground frequencies, typically 27/49/50/53/75/900/2400 for the United States.
- 6.2. Tethered control is typically not allowed.
- 6.3. Pre 1991 non-narrow band radio systems are not allowed.
- 6.4. Radio system restrictions for this event with corresponding weight and or weapon restrictions:
    - 6.4.1. Radio systems that stop all motion in the robot (drive and weapons), when the transmitter loses power or signal, are required for all robots with active weapons or any robot over 12lbs. This may be inherent in the robots electrical system or be part of programmed fail-safes in the radio. Robots 1 lb and less typically will be required to have drive fail-safes.
    - 6.4.2. All robot radio systems must have a way to change frequencies or coded channels to prevent radio conflicts. Having at least two frequencies or coded channels available is required. Lack of extra frequencies may result in a forfeit. Digital spread-spectrum radios that use frequency hopping or automatic channel selection qualify under this rule.
    - 6.4.3. If you are using a home built control system, or a control system not covered here, you must first clear it with the event you plan to attend.
    - 6.4.4. Toy radio systems are sometimes allowed at events for robots up to 12 lbs with no active weapons.
    - 6.4.5. RC systems on the AM band are sometimes allowed at events for robots up to 12 lbs with no active weapons.
    - 6.4.6. All robots that are either: a.) 30 lbs or above or b.) 12 lbs or above with an active weapon MUST use a radio systems on the FM band with PCM, IPD coding, a digitally coded 900 MHz or 2.4GHz system (for example IFI, Spektrum, etc), or an approved custom control system.
- 6.5. This event does not require a separate power switch for the radio, but it is encouraged.
- 6.6. Most events do not provide reserved frequencies/channels for testing and safety.

## 7. Autonomous/Semi-Autonomous Robots
Any robot that moves, seeks a target, or activates weapons without human control is considered autonomous. If your robot is autonomous you are required to contact this event before registration.

- 7.1. Autonomous robots must have a clearly visible light for each autonomous subsystem that indicates whether or not it is in autonomous mode, e.g. if your robot has two autonomous weapons it should have two “autonomous mode” lights (this is separate from any power or radio indicator lights used).
- 7.2. Robots in the 12 pound or under classes are exempt from the remaining rules below, but safe operation, arming, and disarming must be demonstrated in safety inspections.
- 7.3. The autonomous functionality of a robot must have the capability of being remotely armed and disarmed. (This does not include internal sensors, drive gyros, or closed loop motor controls.)
    - 7.3.1. While disarmed, all autonomous functions must be disabled.
    - 7.3.2. When activated the robot must have no autonomous functions enabled, and all autonomous functions must failsafe to off if there is loss of power or radio signal.
    - 7.3.3. In case of damage to components that remotely disarm the robot, the robots autonomous functions are required to automatically disarm within one minute of the match length time after being armed.

## 8. Batteries and Power
- 8.1. The only permitted batteries are ones that cannot spill or spray any of their contents when damaged or inverted. This means that standard automotive and motorcycle wet cell batteries are prohibited. Examples of batteries that are permitted: gel cells, Hawkers, NiCads, NiMh, dry cells, AGM, LIon, LiFe, LiPoly, etc. If your design uses a new type of battery, or one you are not sure about please contact the event you’re planning to attend.
- 8.2. All onboard voltages above 48 Volts require prior approval from this event. (It is understood that a charged battery's initial voltage state is above their nominal rated value)
- 8.3. All electrical power to weapons and drive systems (systems that could cause potential human bodily injury) must have a manual disconnect that can be activated within 15 seconds without endangering the person turning it off. (E.g. No body parts in the way of weapons or pinch points.) Shut down must include a manually operated mechanical method of disconnecting the main battery power, such as a switch (Hella, Whyachi, etc) or removable link. Relays may be used to control power, but there must also be a mechanical disconnect. Please note that complete shut down time is specified in section 3.4.3.
- 8.4. All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire.
- 8.5. If your robot uses a grounded chassis you must have a switch capable of disconnecting this ground. ICE robots are excepted from this rule if there is no practical way to isolate their grounding components. You must contact this event for this exception.
- 8.6. All Robots must have a light easily visible from the outside of the robot that shows its main power is activated.

## 9. Pneumatics
- 9.1. Pneumatic systems on board the robot must only employ non-flammable, nonreactive gases (CO2, Nitrogen and air are most common). It is not permissible to use fiber wound pressure vessels with liquefied gasses like CO2 due to extreme temperature cycling.
- 9.2. You must have a safe and secure method of refilling your pneumatic system.
  - 9.2.1. SPARC recommends the use of standard paintball fill fittings available at many retail outlets and online. For specs see Part#12MPS from Foster, [http://www.couplers.com](http://www.couplers.com).
- 9.3. Exemptions
  - 9.3.1. Robots 12 lbs and under and systems with gas storage of 2 fl oz or less are exempt from the remaining rules in this section provided that the maximum actuation pressure is 250 PSI or less and all components are used within the specifications provided by the manufacturer or supplier. If the specifications aren't available or reliable, then it will be up to the EO to decide if the component is being used in a sufficiently safe manner.
  - 9.3.2. Pneumatic systems with pressures below 100 PSI, small volumes (12-16g CO2 cartridges), single firing applications, or pneumatics used for internal actuation (as opposed to external weaponry) may also be exempted from the remaining pneumatic rules. You are required to contact this event if you would like an exception.
- 9.4. All pneumatic components on board a robot must be securely mounted. Particular attention must be made to pressure vessel mounting and armor to ensure that if ruptured it will not escape the robot. (The terms 'pressure vessel, bottle, and source tank' are used interchangeably)
- 9.5. All pneumatic components within the robot must be rated or certified for AT LEAST the maximum pressure in that part of the system. You may be required to show rating or certification documentation on ANY component in your system.
- 9.6. All pressure vessels must be rated for at least 120% of the pressure they are used at and have a current hydro test date. (This is to give them a margin of safety if damaged during a fight.) If large actuators, lines, or other components are used at pressures above 250psi these will also need to be over-rated and are to be pre-approved for this event.
- 9.7. All primary pressure vessels must have an over pressure device (burst/rupture disk or over pressure 'pop off') set to no more than 130% of that pressure vessels rating. (Most commercially available bottles come with the correct burst assemblies, use of these is encouraged)
- 9.8. If regulators or compressors are used anywhere in the pneumatic system there must be an (additional) over pressure device downstream of the regulator or compressor set for no more than 130% of the lowest rated component in that part of the pneumatic system.
- 9.9. All pneumatic systems must have a manual main shut off valve to isolate the rest of the system from the source tank. This valve must be easily accessed for robot de-activation and refilling.
- 9.10. All pneumatic systems must have a manual bleed valve downstream of the main shut off valve to depressurize the system. This bleed valve must be easily accessed for deactivation. This valve must be left OPEN whenever the robot is not in the arena to ensure the system cannot operate accidentally.
  - 9.10.1. It is required to be able to easily bleed all pressure in the robot before exiting the arena. (You may be required to bleed the entire system if it is believed that you have any damaged components.)
- 9.11. All regulated pneumatic systems must have an appropriate gauge scaled for maximum resolution of the pressure on the low-pressure side of the system. HPA (air, nitrogen, or inert gas) systems must have gauges on both the high AND low-pressure sides of regulators. A gauge or other clear visual indication that the system is charged is strongly recommended for all pneumatic systems. Whether specifically required or not.
- 9.12. If back check valves are used anywhere in the system you must ensure that any part of the system they isolate can be bled and has an over pressure device.
- 9.13. Any pneumatic system that does not use a regulator, or employs heaters or pressure boosters, or pressures above 2500psi must be pre-qualified by the event you’re planning to attend.

## 10. Hydraulics
- 10.1. Robots in the 12 lb class or lighter are exempt from the remaining rules in this section, but good engineering and best practices must be used in all hydraulic systems. However the pressure for 12 pound or less robots is limited to 250psi and there must be an easy way to determine this pressure. Contact the event with any questions.
- 10.2. All hydraulic components onboard a robot must be securely mounted. Particular attention must be made to pump and accumulator mounting and armor to ensure that if ruptured direct fluid streams will not escape the robot.
- 10.3. All hydraulic components within the robot must be rated or certified for AT LEAST the maximum pressure in that part of the system. You may be required to show rating or certification documentation on ANY component in your system.
- 10.4. Any accumulators or large reservoir must be rated for at least 120% of the pressure they are used at. (This is to give them a margin of safety if damaged during a fight)
- 10.5. All hydraulic systems must have an over pressure bypass device set to no more than 130% of the lowest component rating. It must be rated to bypass the full volume of the hydraulic pump.
- 10.6. All hydraulic systems must have an accessible manual bypass valve(s) to easily render the system harmless.
- 10.7. All hydraulic systems must have appropriate gauges scaled for maximum resolution of the pressures in that part of the system.
- 10.8. All hydraulic systems must use non-flammable, non-corrosive fluid and must be designed not to leak when inverted.
- 10.9. Any hydraulic system using pressure boosters, or pressures above 5000psi (without accumulator) or pressures above 2000psi (with accumulator) must be pre-qualified by the event.
- 10.10. Please note that some simple low pressure and volume hydraulic systems, like simple braking, may not need to adhere to all the rules above. You are required to contact the event if you would like an exception.

## 11. Internal Combustion Engines (ICE)
**OSCR does not currently host robots powered by internal combustion engines.**

Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) and liquid fuels are typically not allowed, however some events/venues do allow them.

- 11.1. Fuel and Fuel Lines

- 11.5. All engines must turn off or return to idle at loss of radio signal and turn off at loss of radio receiver power.
- 11.6. All engines must have a method of remotely shutting off.
- 11.7. Any robot with liquid fuel and oil must be designed not to leak when inverted. (Minor oil leakage may be tolerated, however if it affects the other robot or becomes a large cleanup issue you may be called and the leaking robot will forfeit.)
- 11.8.Use of engines other than standard piston engines (i.e. turbines etc.) require prior approval for any event.

## 12. Rotational weapons or full body spinning robots
Rotational weapons or full body spinning robots are allowed at most events, however:

## 16. Weight Class Variants
§16.1 and §16.2, OSCR does not host Sportsman or Open-Air classes

- ~~16.1. Sportsman Class 3 . A robot may be entered in the “Sportsman” class if it complies with the additional rules in this section. Any robot may be entered in the “standard” class of the same weight.~~
  - ~~16.1.1. Active Weapon Required. Your bot must include an active weapon or device. These include but are not limited to lifters, hammers, clamps, spinning weapons (within limitations, see below), etc. Weapons such as a fixed spike that require the movement of the bot to function do not qualify as active weapons. (within the limitations specified in 4.2.3)~~
  - ~~16.1.2. Limitations on Spinning Weapons. All devices rotating more than 360 degrees are allowed to operate with a tip speed at or below 20ft/s. (Approximate tip speed = no load RPM * diameter in inches * 0.00436) Weapon rpm will be measured by tachometer prior to the start of the event. Specific weapons of sufficiently high mass or moment of inertia (MOI) may be limited to lower speeds or disallowed by officials if they deem the weapon to be too destructive. Officials may require submission of specifications including motor, voltage, gearing ratio, weapon weight and dimensions prior to the event.~~
    - ~~16.1.2.1. Sawing, drilling and other spinning weapons will be allowed to exceed the 20ft/s limit so long as they meet the following requirements:~~
      - ~~16.1.2.1.1. The effective tooth pitch for the saw or saw like weapon is ≥5. (Effective pitch = tooth count / diameter) For example, a 10” saw blade with 60 teeth would meet this requirement. A 10” saw blade with 40 teeth would not. For abrasives the grit size will be used to determine if the requirements are met. (Tooth count = grit * circumference )~~
      - ~~16.1.2.1.2. Saws and saw like weapons are limited to the manufacturer's rated RPM. If you are using a custom blade it will be limited to the rated rpm of an equivalent commercial blade. (± 5% on tooth count, diameter, thickness) Additionally, the maximum spinning mass for saws and saw-like weapons is 15% of the total bot mass. This includes any mounting hubs, shafts, flywheels, pulleys, and other structures mechanically linked to the rotation of the saw blade.~~
      - ~~16.1.2.1.3 Wheel-like and rubber spinning weapons are allowed without a specific tooth density requirement. Excessively destructive implementations may be restricted at the event organizers discretion.~~
      - ~~16.1.2.1.4. All weapons operating above the 20ft/s limit must be submitted to the event organizer for approval during the registration period.~~
  - ~~16.1.3. Wedge Limitations. Active wedges are allowed with no restrictions. A robot may only have a single passive wedge.~~
    - ~~16.1.3.1. An active wedge is defined as a wedge that articulated and actuated independently of the drive system.~~
    - ~~16.1.3.2. A passive wedge is any wedge or wedge like object (forks, series of small, hinged, independent wedges along the same face of the robot) that does not meet the requirements for classification as an active wedge.~~
    - ~~16.1.3.3. At the event organizers discretion any weapons being primarily used as a passive wedge may be required to undergo modifications to reduce or remove this potential prior to continuing in a tournament should this use result in the robot being in violation of the restriction on the number of passive wedges permitted.~~
  - ~~16.1.4. Excessively Destructive Weapons. Weapons deemed too destructive by virtue of their mass, MOI or other characteristics may be further limited or disallowed at the discretion of the event. Please contact the event organizer concerning your design to avoid problems.~~
  - ~~16.1.5. Standard SPARC Rules Apply. Unless otherwise stated, all other standard SPARC rules will apply. This includes walkers and their weight bonuses. However, a walker that uses the weight bonus for a spinning (or other) weapon that is too destructive will be disqualified.~~
- ~~16.2. Open Air Combat Classes. For events where some or all classes compete in an open air environment the following restrictions apply.~~
  - ~~16.2.1. Slow spinners are allowed with an absolute maximum tip speed of 20 feet per second and may spin in any direction. The tip speed in feet per second is calculated by this formula: Tip Speed = RPM x Diameter x .00436.~~
  - ~~16.2.2. Additionally, any weapon systems that may be capable of tearing off pieces of the opponent (flippers, axes, etc…) must be cleared with the event organizer prior to competing.~~
- 16.3. Plastic Classes. The spirit of these classes is to have an easy entry point for new builders and to encourage creative designs by limiting materials to plastics that are easy to work with, commonly used in 3D printers and don’t have strength characteristics common in the standard classes. Components used for structure, armor, and weapons must be 3D printed.
  - 16.3.1. PET, PETG, ABS, PLA, PLA+, and ASA are the only materials that can be used for the chassis and weapons. No other types of plastics or materials allowed (ie. metal, carbon fiber, UHMW, etc). At their discretion, event organizers may allow additional plastics that meet the spirit of the rules. Materials that are functionally identical to PLA+ but have a different name for marketing purposes will be considered PLA+ when determining legality.
  - 16.3.2. Composite and blended materials that use legal materials as a base are not permitted. Examples include but are not limited to: Carbon Fiber PLA, Glass Filled ABS, and Flex PLA.
  - 16.3.3. Non-plastic parts such as motors, electronics, axles, fasteners and adhesives can be any material, but cannot be used in such a way to enhance the structural integrity, armor the robot, or enhance any weapon. Magnets to enhance traction or downforce are prohibited. Foam and rubber or rubber like materials including silicone, urethane, and TPU are allowed for wheels and padding of electronics provided they meet the requirements of this section. Additionally custom cast wheels are permitted provided they meet the requirements of this section.
  - 16.3.4. While painting robots is permitted, excessive coatings are subject to event organizer review and approval.
  - 16.3.5. Robots may be disqualified at the Event Organizer’s discretion if it is deemed to violate the spirit of the class. Contact the event organizer ahead of time if you are not sure your robot meets the above definition.

# OSCR's SPARC Match Rules v1.4

## Bot Load In and Activation
**OSCR does not have a combat area large enough to stand in**

In arenas where robot power up is possible with the driver not standing on the combat area preference will be given to that method.

- The combat area is defined as the region of the arena where active combat occurs. This would exclude gutters between whatever internal barricade exists in the arena and the arena walls.

Priority for load in is as follows:

- Least dangerous bot being activated by someone inside the combat area
- Most dangerous bot being activated by someone inside the combat area
- Least dangerous bot being activated by someone outside the combat area
- Most dangerous bot being activated by someone outside the combat area

The process for activating a robot is as follows:

- Robot is placed in a stable position on the combat area with the drive wheels oriented such that when they come in contact with the combat area the direction of travel will be away from other robots, persons, and entry doors. If the robot has a weapon that is aimable it will be aimed at the wall furthest from the arena entry door.
- Weapon covers are removed.
- Transmitter is turned on.
- Main power is turned on.
- If separate, weapon power is turned on. This applies to both a separate power loop and non-electrical power systems. (i.e. pneumatics)
- Weapon locks are removed.
- If the robot is being activated by a person inside the combat area, they then exit the arena, otherwise the robot is driven to the starting square from their power on location.
- No movement or functional testing is permitted while anyone is on the combat area.
Once both robots are activated and in their starting squares the arena access point will be closed and a maximum of 20 seconds will be allowed for a brief weapon/drive system test if the drivers so desire. No weapon testing of any sort will be allowed prior to the arena door being closed. In the event that the arena is equipped with multiple access doors and each robot is loaded through a separate door the door will be opened to allow load in then shut once the operator is out of the arena.

After this, the referee will ask both drivers if they are ready and the fight will begin.

## Post Fight Activities
At the end of the fight both robots are to cease movement and if applicable, allow their weapon systems to de-energize. Once the weapon systems have been de-energized the judges may request that one or both robots demonstrate that either their drive or weapon system is still functional

- Demonstration of drive system functionality will be done by the robot returning to its starting location.
- Demonstration of weapon system functionality will be done by the robot returning to its starting location and briefly applying power to the weapon system to show that it is still operational. The robot will not spin to full speed during this demonstration.

Once this is completed the robot deactivation and load out procedure can begin.

## Bot Deactivation and Load Out
OSCR does not have a combat area large enough to stand in

In arenas where robot power down is possible with the driver not standing on the combat area preference will be given to that method. In the event of an unexpected situation the order in which robots are powered down may be altered by the referee.

- The combat area is defined as the region of the arena where active combat occurs. This would exclude gutters between whatever internal barricade exists in the arena and the arena walls.

Priority for load out is as follows:

- Most dangerous bot being deactivated by someone outside the combat area
- Least dangerous bot being deactivated down by someone outside the combat area
- Most dangerous bot being deactivated down by someone inside the combat area
- Least dangerous bot being deactivated down by someone inside the combat area

The process for deactivating a robot is as follows:

- Weapon system is disabled. This includes any applicable weapon locks, power cut-off and venting. The exact order of this procedure will be left to the discretion of the builder as differing designs may necessitate different safe shutdown procedures.
- Main power is turned off.
- Transmitter is turned off.
- Weapon covers are reinstalled.
- If the robot is able to be removed from the arena without a cart/assistance it may be removed at this time, otherwise robots will be removed from the arena once all robots have had their weapon locks installed and are powered down.

## Emergency Deactivation Procedure
In the event of an emergency (for example: one or more robots on fire) the standard procedure does not apply. The following attempts to address the vast majority of possible situations that are likely to occur:

- One robot is burning and the other is mobile
    - The mobile robot is to move to the wall furthest from the arena entry door and align its drive wheels parallel with the wall. If the robot has an active weapon it is to immediately begin dissipating stored energy (spinning down, release for spring actuated weapons, etc.) and if possible, bring it next to or into contact with the wall it is aimed at.
    - Once the working robot is in position the arena marshal will enter the arena and extinguish the fire, then if possible, remove the robot from the arena.
    - The operator of the non-burning robot may then proceed with normal load out procedures.
- One robot is burning and the other is immobile
    - If the immobile robot has an active weapon it is to immediately begin dissipating stored energy. (spinning down, release for spring actuated weapons, etc) If the robot retains some degree of mobility but cannot move in a reliable manner it will attempt to angle itself such that any weapons that are aimable are aimed at the wall furthest from the arena entry door.
    - Once the arena is able to be entered safely the arena marshal will enter the arena and extinguish the fire, then if possible, remove the robot from the arena.
    - The operator of the non-burning robot may then proceed with normal load out procedures.
- Both robots are burning
    - Both robots will, if applicable, immediately attempt to dissipate any stored energy systems and will attempt no other actions.
    - Once the arena is able to be entered safely the arena marshal will enter the arena and extinguish the fire, then if possible, remove both robots from the arena.
- One or more robots are burning during a rumble
    - All mobile, non-burning robots will move to the closest arena wall that is not used to access the arena and begin dissipating stored energy.
    - All immobile robots will immediately begin dissipating stored energy and will perform no other actions unless they are able to rotate such that they are able to angle any aimable weapon systems at the wall furthest from the arena entry door.
    - Once the arena is able to be entered safely the arena marshal will enter the arena and extinguish the fire, then if possible, remove the robot from the arena.
    - If there is time left, the match will be allowed to resume.
- One or more robots are acting erratically/stuck on
  - The operator(s) of the robot(s) will turn off their transmitters to attempt to activate the robots failsafe.
    - If this works then normal load out procedures will resume.
  - In the event that the robot(s) are still acting erratically the robots will be allowed to drain their batteries until they are safe to approach.
  - Should a robot in the arena still be fully functional, no weapon system be active on the malfunctioning robot and all involved operators agree to it the operator of the still working robot may attempt to pin and prop up the malfunctioning robot such that its wheels are no longer in contact with the ground. The operator of the malfunctioning robot will then be allowed to power off their robot. Once powered off they will exit the arena and the robot that was pinning the malfunctioning robot will be allowed to go through normal load out procedures. The malfunctioning robot will then complete its load out procedures

## Emergency Match Stoppage Procedure
In the event of an arena breach, damage to the arena that renders it unsafe, or any other event that is otherwise judged a safety risk by event staff the match shall immediately be halted. For sufficiently large or loud arenas there should be a system in place to allow any event official to quickly act to stop the fight either by triggering a notification system or having direct communication with an official that does that won’t be impacted by distance or arena noise.

It is strongly encouraged that there is both an audible (alarm, buzzer, air horn, or similar) and visual (arena lights off, flashing red lights, a deployed curtain, or similar) indication that the fight has been stopped to ensure that competitors are aware of the issue immediately. It is the responsibility of the team to ensure that the driver or another team member is watching and/or listening for these indicators.

If a competitor continues to fight after the referee has called for the fight to be stopped they will be disqualified. Repeated infractions will result in removal from the tournament. It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that they respond promptly to the call to stop fighting.

Once fighting has ceased the robots will be deactivated. The deactivated robots may be left in place or moved to a safe location in or around the arena until a determination about the status of the fight is made. No work may be done on the bots during this time. The source of the safety issue will then be inspected to determine the appropriate action. Once the issue has been resolved a determination will be made as to whether or not the fight will resume. If possible, the fight will resume from the point where it was paused. If resuming the fight is determined to not be possible due to a safety concern or other issue the fight will be judged up until the point where it was stopped.

The safety of the crowd, competitors, and crew must always be considered when determining if any additional measures need to be taken beyond resolving the immediate safety issue.

## Match Formats
**OSCR hosts double elimination events**

- Round Robin (Standard format for classes with 5 or fewer robots entered)
  - Each robot faces each other robot in the weight class a single time. The robot with the greatest number of wins is declared the winner. In the event of a tie, the winner of the match between the two robots is declared the winner. Should more than two bots tie for the win the winner will be determined with a judged rumble.
  - If desired, a double round robin format can be used where each robot will face each other robot twice. The same criteria is used for determining a winner. Should the results necessitate it, a tie-breaker match may be run to determine which robot places higher.
- Single Elimination
  - This format uses a standard single elimination bracket.
- **Double Elimination** (Standard format for classes with 6 or more robots entered)
  - In a double elimination bracket all robots start in the winners bracket. The losing robot in a winners bracket match will move to the losers bracket. The losing robot in a losers bracket match is eliminated from the tournament.
  - In this format, the robot that “wins” the losers bracket will need to defeat the robot that “wins” the winners bracket twice to win the overall event.
- Modified Double Elimination
  - The format is the same as a double elimination bracket however the overall final is treated as single elimination, meaning that if the robot that “wins” the losers bracket will only have to defeat the robot that “wins” the winners bracket a single time to win the overall event.
- Other
  - Any match formats used not described above will be the responsibility of the host event to clearly describe.

## Match Frequency
**OSCR hosts 150 gram, one pound and three pound robots**

Robots weighing between 150g and 6lb will be given a minimum of 20 minutes between matches. Robots weighing greater than 6lb will be given a minimum of 30 minutes between matches.

## Match Duration
**OSCR hosts 150 gram, one pound and three pound robots and uses a 3 minute match duration.**

The standard match duration for 150g-6lb robots is 3 minutes. The standard match duration for robots weighing more than 6lbs is 3 minutes. The standard match duration for a rumble in any weight class is 5 minutes.

(Option) The match duration for 150g-6lb robots is 2 minutes.

## Un-sticks
**OSCR uses "The Arena is a Hazard" option. Only entangled bots qualify for Un-sticks.**

Matches will be paused to separate robots in the event that they become stuck together in the arena. Robots that become stuck together will be allowed 10 seconds to attempt to separate. If they are not able to do so an un-stick will be called for by the referee. An un-stick can only be called for by the drivers or referee and the referee has the final say on whether or not the un-stick will be granted based upon the events un-stick rules. No modifications or repairs are allowed during an unstick.

**Additional Un-stick options:**

- **“The Arena is a Hazard”** -No un-sticks for a single robot being immobilized due to terrain independent of cause
- “Single un-stick” -Each robot gets one un-stick independent of cause. Only the driver of the stuck robot can call for an un-stick in this situation. With multi-bots, all parts of the multi-bot are only given a single un-stick.
- “Modified single un-stick” (Standard) -Each robot gets one un-stick but only if the opposing robot was not the cause for their immobilization. For example, if a robot were to get itself stuck on the arena wall somehow, they would get an unstick. If the robot were placed against the wall in a manner that prevented operation, (ie, rammed into a stuck position, weapon contact causes a stuck position, lifted into position, etc) they would not get an un-stick. The referee will determine if this applies. Only the driver of the stuck robot can call for an un-stick in this situation.As with “single un-stick” all parts of a multi-bot share a single un-stick.

## Knock-outs
**OSCR uses the (Option)**

When a robot has ceased moving in a controlled manner but has not tapped out the referee will begin a 10 second countdown. If the robot is unable to demonstrate controlled translational movement before the countdown ends it will be declared the loser by KO. If during this time the robot is able to show controlled translational movement or if the opposing robot attacks it the countdown will cease. This means that a “dead” robot will not be counted out should the opposing robot continue to attack and the match will not end until the match timer expires or one robot taps out.

A bot with one side of its drivetrain disabled will not be counted out if it can demonstrate controlled translational movement. Controlled translational movement is defined as being able to traverse in a manner such that the net movements of the robot are in a linear direction.

In the case of multi-bots, the countdown will begin when at least 51% of the mass of the multi-bot is unable to move. _A visual identifier is required on a multibot segment if that segment alone meets the knock-out threshold._

In the event of a simultaneous knock-out both robots will be placed in their standard orientation on the combat area by the arena marshal/referee and allowed an attempt to demonstrate controlled movement. If both robots are able to function the match will resume. If one robot is able to function that robot will be declared the winner. If neither robot is able to function the match will go to the judges.

**(Option) Should the battery of a robot become exposed the match will be halted and the robot with the exposed battery will lose by TKO.**

## Death Zones/Push-outs
**OSCR uses the (Option)**

If the arena is equipped with a Death Zone/Pit/Push-out or similar hazard a robot entering this area in a one on one match will result in the end of the match and a loss for the robot that first entered the area. In a rumble any robots entering the area will be eliminated from the rumble and are to cease the operation of weapon systems immediately.

**(Option) The death zone may be used as an immobilization zone instead, allowing the robot a chance to attempt to escape while it is being counted out. If the robot is able to escape before being counted out the match will continue as normal.**

In the event that both robots enter the death zone simultaneously they will be returned to the combat area and the match will resume. A robot that places its opponent in the death zone must be able to do so without also becoming stuck itself. If it is not able to separate from the other robot this will be treated as simultaneous entry.

## Pinning/Lifting
Any robot pinning or lifting their opponent may only continue to pin or lift them for 10 seconds at a time. After 10 seconds has elapsed the robot in control must release the opposing robot. If the robot in control is not able to release the opposing robot then the match will be halted and the robots will be separated.

- “Release” is defined as complete physical separation such that both robots are able to freely move away from their current location.
- Refusal to comply with the referee’s request to release the opponent when the robots are not stuck together will result in forfeit of the match.

## Tapping Out
At any time during a match the robot operator may choose to tap out. Once an operator has tapped out combat will cease and the opposing robot will be declared the winner.

- Tapping out is done either by informing the referee that you are tapping out verbally or by using a designated tap out button or similar object should one be available.

# OSCR's SPARC Tournament Procedures v1.1

## Weight Classes
**OSCR only hosts one pound Antweight classes**

|         |         |                        |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| 0.33 lb | 150g    | Fairyweight            |
| 1 lb    | 454g    | Antweight              |
| 2.2 lb  | 1 kg    | Kilobot                |

| 242.5lb | 110kg   | RobotWars Heavyweight  |
| 250lb   | 113.4kg | BattleBots Heavyweight |

## Weight Verification
**OSCR uses the (Option)**

A robot may be re-weighed at any time during a tournament at the request of an event official or judge. The time required to verify that the robot is still within the legal weight limit will not be counted against the robots guaranteed time between matches. In the event that the robot in question is less than 5% over the weight limit they will need to be made underweight prior to their next match. If the robot is in excess of 5% above the weight limit they will forfeit their prior match and will need to be made underweight prior to their next match. If repeated infractions occur in during the same event the robot will be disqualified from the event. If a robot has been modified since its last match the team will be responsible for ensuring that any repairs or modifications done stay within the weight limit. In the event that an event official calls for a re-weigh immediately following a match (prior to either robot returning tothe pit area or having any work done to them) both robots will be weighed to confirm that they are within the weight limit. If one of the two robots is overweight it will immediately forfeit the match. If both robots are found to be overweight the original match result will stand and both robots will be required to be brought below the weight limit prior to their next match.

(Optional Camera Rule) If it is approved by the event officials the addition of a small camera and protective shroud may be added to a robot even if such a system would exceed the normal weight limit. Any mount and shroud must be designed to provide protection and support to the camera only. This mount should be designed for easy removal for separate weighing of the bot if applicable.

## Unsportsmanlike Conduct
Unsportsmanlike Conduct includes but is not limited to: Post fight contact, sabotage, distraction of opposing robot operators, blatant early movement, etc.

For the first incident of unintentional unsportsmanlike conduct the person responsible will receive a warning. These warnings will carry over between events and will expire 25 months after the date of the incident. For the second incident of unintentional unsportsmanlike conduct the person responsible will automatically forfeit the match. For any instance of clearly intentional (as ruled by the judges or event officials) unsportsmanlike conduct, the driver of the robot will be disqualified for the remainder of the event. This means that if they are driving robots in the tournament they will need to find driver substitutes or those robots will be unable to continue to compete. In the event that the unsportsmanlike conduct occurs during the finals of a double elimination tournament that is structured such that if the robot in the losers bracket wins the two robots will fight again, the driver initiating the contact will forfeit not only the current match, but the match that potentially would follow.

# OSCR's SPARC Judging Guidelines v1.2

## General
The Judges will be located close enough to the referee/arena marshal that communication will not be hindered by the noise levels typical to a robot combat event. When a match does not end in the elimination of one of the Combatants as defined by the Match Rules the winner shall be determined by a Judges' Decision. In a Judges' Decision the points awarded to the Combatants by the panel of judges are totaled and the robot with the majority of points is declared the winner.

**Judges decisions are final.**

## Judging Guidelines
**OSCR uses the "Damage, Control, and Aggression Criteria"**

Two sets of judging criteria are provided to allow individual events to choose which format they would like to use based upon the desired complexity and emphasis of the scoring system. _The Damage and Engagement criteria entirely replaces the simplified judging criteria from prior revisions of this document. The “Standard Judging Criteria” has been renamed to the “Damage, Control, and Aggression Criteria” for consistency._ 

## Damage and Engagement Criteria
### Damage - 4 Points
Damage is about what is left at the end of the fight. Judges should note pre-existing damage and ignore it when it comes to rating the level of damage at the end of the match. The exception to this is damage that, if ignored, prevents an entry from reaching the maximum achievable damage grade. Typically this will only apply to drive functionality.

- **A Tier**: No damage, cosmetic damage, or minor damage to purely ablative armor
- **B Tier**: Significant damage to purely ablative armor, minor damage to mobility systems that do not noticeably hinder movement, damage to structure or armor that does not significantly hinder function.
- **C Tier**: Damage to the mobility system or weapon system(s) that moderately hinders function, or damage that significantly impairs the function of a robot's structure or armor.
- **D Tier**: Significant impairment of drive or weapon systems
- **E Tier**: Significant impairment of drive and weapon systems

To qualify as “purely ablative” armor an element must be clearly designed to serve the sole purpose of being damaged or destroyed to absorb damage to protect the main structure of the robot.

Significant impairment of the drive is classified as crab walking (appears to be translating via one drive side) or worse. Significant impairment of the weapon is all weapon system elements being rendered non-functional.

For robots that rely on their weapon systems for mobility damage to the weapon system such that it impacts their mobility will be considered damage to both systems. For robots with independently powered weapons wedges, plows, forks, and other similar elements will be considered part of their structure or armor.

For robots without independently powered weapons whichever feature they attack with will be treated as their weapon system. For multibots the damage level should be averaged between all segments that participated in the match. If the average lands between grades the final grade should be rounded down. (Between C and D would become C)

**Damage Scoring**

- 2-2: 0-1 grades of separation.
- 3-1: 2 grades of separation.
- 4-0: 3+ grades of separation

### Engagement - 5 points
Engagement is about which robot takes charge of the flow of the match. Robots that score well in engagement will bring the fight to their opponent.

**Engagement Examples**

Actions that positively contribute to engagement

- Attacking the opponent
- Pinning the opponent
- Getting the opponent stuck/high centered
- Chasing the opponent
- Inverting the opponent if it significantly impacts their ability to engage with the opponent

Actions that negatively contribute to engagement

- Sitting in one area waiting for the opponent to attack
- Fleeing from the opponent
- Performing anything from the positive contribution section to your own entry instead of your opponent

Actions that are neutral with respect to engagement

- Brief disengagements to prepare/reset/spin up your weapon
- Self righting attempts
- Inversion that does not impact a robots ability to fight
- Missed attacks

For scoring engagement in fights involving multibots you should look at how the entry as a whole influenced the flow of the match.

A robot being slower should not directly impact its engagement score. Focus on what the robot is doing, not how fast it is doing it.

**Engagement Scoring**

- 3-2
    - This robot spent a slightly larger portion of the match dictating the flow of the fight
    - Throughout the fight this robot consistently maintained a slight edge on directing the flow of the match
- 4-1
    - This robot spent a large portion of the match dictating the flow of the fight
    - This robot consistently maintained a significant edge on directing the flow of the match
- 5-0
    - This robot spent most or all of the match dictating the flow of the fight

## Damage, Control, and Aggression Criteria
### 1.1. Point Scoring System
- Points are awarded in 3 categories:
    - Aggression - 5 points
    - Control - 6 points
    - Damage - 6 points
- All points must be awarded - each judge will determine how many points to award each Combatant in each category, according to the Judging Guidelines (see below). The maximum possible score a Combatant receives is 17 * (number of judges). Thus, a single judge will award a total of 17 points, and a 3 judge panel will award a total of 51 points.
### 1.2. Judging Guidelines
- **1.2.1. Scoring Aggression**
    - Aggression scoring will be based on the relative amount of time each robot spends attacking the other.
    - Attacks do not have to cause damage to count for aggression points, but a distinction will be made between chasing a fleeing opponent and randomly crashing around the arena.
    - Points will not be awarded for aggression if a robot is completely uncontrollable or unable to do more than turn in place, even if it is trying to attack.
    - Sitting still and waiting for your opponent to drive into your weapon does not count for aggression points, even if it is an amazingly destructive weapon. Robot must show translational movement toward their opponent for it to be counted as aggression.
    - **Awarding Aggression Points**
        - 5-0: a 5-0 score shall be awarded only when one of the robots never attempts to attack the other, and the other consistently attacks.
        - 4-1: a score of 4-1 shall be awarded in the case of significant dominance of attacks by one robot, with the other only attempting to attack a few times during the match.
        - 3-2: a 3-2 score shall be awarded when
            - Both robots consistently attack the other.
            - Both robots only attack the other for part of the match.
            - Both robots spend most of the match avoiding each other. In this case it will be up to the judge's discretion to decide which robot made more attempts to make attack the other.
            - A Combatant who attacks a full-body spinner (e.g. intentionally drives within the perimeter of the spinning weapon) is automatically considered the aggressor and awarded a 3-2 score in the case where either robots consistently attack, or both robots consistently avoid each other.
            - There can be no ties in aggression. Judges must decide that one robot is more aggressive than the other.
        - Note: a Combatant is considered a "full body spinner" if the robot cannot be attacked without moving within the perimeter of the spinning weapon.
- **1.2.2. Scoring Control**
    - Control scoring will be based on the relative amount of time each robot spends in control of the fight.
    - The primary means of scoring points in this category involves using elements of the robot or arena against the opponent in a manner that doesn’t directly involve the weapon system of the robot causing damage. This would include utilizing any arena hazards to cause damage to the opposing robot.
    - Examples of control include:
        - A grabbing/lifting/wedge robot making guiding contact with the opposing robot and delivering them to an arena hazard or hitting them against the combat surface and/or arena walls.
        - Flipping over the opposing robot.
        - Immobilizing or otherwise stalling the opponents weapon.
        - A spinning robot being able to get its weapon to full speed.
    - **Awarding Control Points**
        - 6-0: a 6-0 score shall be awarded only when one robot completely controls the momentum of the match. Examples of this would include: A wedge or ramming robot preventing a spinning weapon from ever reaching full speed, A grabber or crusher consistently grabbing and manipulating its opponent with little to no offense from the opponent, a flipper reliably flipping its opponent without frequent missed flips, and a spinner being able to consistently and repeatedly get its weapon back to speed after hitting the opponent.
        - 5-1: a score of 5-1 shall be awarded in the case of significant dominance by one competitor. The competitor receiving 5 points should frequently exhibit the relevant behaviors noted in the control example section with only short periods of the opposing robot gaining the upper hand.
        - 4-2: a score of 4-2 shall be awarded in the case of slight dominance by one competitor. The competitor receiving 4 points should exhibit the relevant behaviors noted in the control example section for a clear majority of the match.
        - 3-3: a 3-3 score shall be awarded when both robots are either able to demonstrate control for a significant portion of the match or neither robot are able to reasonably demonstrate control during a match.
- **1.2.3. Scoring Damage**
    - Judges should be knowledgeable about how different materials are damaged. Some materials such as Titanium will send off bright sparks when hit but are still very strong and may be largely undamaged. Other materials such as Aluminum will not send off bright sparks when hit. Judges should not be influenced by things like sparks, but rather how deep or incapacitating a "wound" is.
    - Judges should be knowledgeable about the different materials used in Bot construction and how damage to these materials can reduce a Bot's functionality. Judges should not to be unduly influenced by highly visual damage that doesn't affect a Combatant's functionality effectiveness or defensibility. For example, a gash in a Combatant's armor may be very visible but only minimally reduce the armor's functionality.
    - Judges should look for damage that may not be visually striking but affects the functionality of a Combatant. For example:
        - A small bend in a lifting arm or spinner weapon may dramatically affect its functionality by preventing it from having its full range of motion
        - Bent armor or skirts can prevent the Combatant from resting squarely on the floor, reducing the effectiveness of the drive train
        - A wobbly wheel indicates that it is bent and will not get as much traction.
        - Cuts or holes through armor may mean there is more damage inside.
    - **Trivial**:
        - Flip over (or being propelled onto bumper, ramp, or other obstacle) causing no loss of mobility or loss of weapon functionality, except where flipping causes full loss of mobility and robot is unable to show translational movement.
        - Direct impacts which do not leave a visible dent or scratch.
        - Sparks resulting from strike of opponent's weapon
        - Being lifted in the air with no damage and no lasting loss of traction.
    - **Cosmetic**:
        - Visible scratches to armor.
        - Non-penetrating cut or dent or slight bending of armor or exposed frame.
        - Removal of non-structural, non-functional cosmetic pieces (dolls, foliage, foam, or "ablative" armor).
        - Damage to wheel, spinning blade, or other exposed moving part not resulting in loss of functionality or mobility.
    - **Minor**:
        - Flip over (or being propelled onto bumper or other obstacle) causing some loss of mobility or control or making it impossible to use a weapon.
        - Intermittent smoke not associated with noticeable power drop.
        - Penetrating dent or small hole.
        - Removal of most or all of a wheel, or saw blade, spike, tooth, or other weapon component, which does not result in a loss of functionality or mobility.
        - Slightly warped frame not resulting in loss of mobility or weapon function.
    - **Significant**:
        - Continuous smoke, or smoke associated with partial loss of power of drive or weapons.
        - Torn, ripped, or badly warped armor or large hole punched in armor.
        - Damage or removal of wheels resulting in impaired mobility
        - Damage to rotary weapon resulting in loss of weapon speed or severe vibration
        - Damage to arm, hammer, or other moving part resulting in partial loss of weapon functionality.
        - Visibly bent or warped frame/weapon that results in partial impairment to the function of the damaged system.
    - **Major**:
        - Smoke and visible fire.
        - Armor section completely removed exposing interior components.
        - Removal of wheels, spinning blade, saw, hammer, or lifting arm, or other major component (including wedges/plows) resulting in total loss of weapon functionality or mobility.
        - Frame warping causing partial loss of mobility or complete loss of functionality of weapon system.
        - Internal components (batteries, speed controller, radio, motor) broken free from mounts and resting or dragging on the arena floor.
        - Significant leak of hydraulic fluid.
        - Obvious leaks of pneumatic gases.
        - Apparent complete loss of weapon system function.
    - **Massive**:
        - Armor shell completely torn off frame.
        - Major subassemblies torn free from frame.
        - Loss of structural integrity -major frame or armor sections dragging or resting on floor.
        - Total loss of power.
    - **Post-Match Inspection**
        - Judges may request the combatant's to demonstrate operability of their robot's drive train and/or weapon following the end of the match, before the arena doors are opened.
        - Judges may inspect the Combatant's robot after a match to determine how best to award damage points. If a judge needs to examine one or both of the Combatants robot's before awarding damage points, he or she will notify the Stage Manager or other designated official immediately after the end of the match. The inspection will be conducted by the entire panel. The judges will not handle the Combatant's robot. The driver or a designated team member will handle the Combatant's robot. A member of the opponent's team will be present during any such inspection.
    - **Awarding Damage Points**
        - Scoring of damage points is based on relative grading of each robot's damage.
            - 6-0: a 6-0 score shall be awarded when:
                - One robot suffers nothing more than trivial damage, and the other is at least significantly damaged
                - One robot has suffered major or massive damage and the other is no more than cosmetically damaged.
            - 5-1: a 5-1 score shall be awarded when:
                - One robot suffers at least minor damage and the other suffers major or worse damage
                - One robot has suffered cosmetic damage and the other has suffered at least significant damage.
            - 4-2: a 4-2 score shall be awarded when:
                - Both robots have suffered nearly the same level of damage but one is slightly more damaged than the other
                - One robot has suffered trivial or cosmetic damage and the other has suffered minor damage
            - 3-3: a 3-3 score shall be awarded when:
                - Both robots have suffered the same level of damage, or
                - Neither robot has even cosmetically damaged the other
        - Damage that is self-inflicted by a robot's own systems and not directly or indirectly caused by contact with the other robot or an active arena hazard will not be counted against that robot for scoring purposes.
