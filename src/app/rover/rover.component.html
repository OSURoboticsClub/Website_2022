            Mars Rover is a multidisciplinary team of dedicated engineers, scientists and robotics enthusiasts committed to designing, building and operating a small-scale Mars Rover. The group is split into four subteams: Electrical, Mechanical, Science, and Software. Each subteam is responsible for designing, developing and implementing every component on the rover; from custom PCBs by Electrical, a six-axis arm by Mechanical, in-situ life detection by Science, to autonomous navigation by Software.
